=head1 NAME

wg-meta - CLI interface to manage Wireguard using Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This CLI interface is a (possible) implementation of L<Wireguard::WGmeta::Wrapper::Show> and L<Wireguard::WGmeta::Wrapper::Config>.
An you don't know the best yet: It's fully compatible with your existing setup (if not let me know!)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Intended to use as command wrapper for the C<wg show> and C<wg set> commands. Support for C<wg-quick> is enabled by default.

Please note that B<all> non-meta attributes have to be specified in the `wg set` _syntax_, which means _AllowedIPs_ becomes
allowed-ips and so on. wg-meta attributes on the other hand, have to be written in the exact same way as they were introduced!

    $ wg-meta help

    wg-meta - An approach to add meta data to the Wireguard configuration
    Usage: wg-meta <cmd> [<args>]
    Available subcommands:
             show: Shows the current configuration paired with available metadata
             set:  Sets configuration attributes
             enable:  Enables a peer
             disable:  Disables a peer
             addpeer:  Adds a peer and prints the client config to std_out
             removepeer:  Removes a peer
             apply:  Just a shorthand for `wg syncconf <iface> <(wg-quick strip <iface>)`
    You may pass `help` to any of these subcommands to view their usage

    sudo wg-meta set wg0 IPv6_only1 +description "Some Desc"

    # Lets check our newly set attributes
