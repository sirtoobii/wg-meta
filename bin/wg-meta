=head1 NAME

wg-meta - CLI interface to manage Wireguard using Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This CLI interface is a (possible) implementation of L<Wireguard::WGmeta::Wrapper::Show> and L<Wireguard::WGmeta::Wrapper::Config>.
An you don't know the best yet: It's fully compatible with your existing setup (if not let me know!)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Intended to use as command wrapper for the C<wg show> and C<wg set> commands. Support for C<wg-quick> is enabled by default.

Please note that B<all> attributes have to be specified in the `wg set` _syntax_, which means _AllowedIPs_ becomes
allowed-ips and so on.
